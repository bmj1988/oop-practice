// In this phase you will create a `Manager` class that inherits from the
// `Employee` class you just made. Run the test specs using
// `npm test test/02-create-manager-spec.js`. Once the specs pass, use the local
// tests provided below to see your app in action.

// Begin by creating a __manager.js__ file and requiring your `Employee` module.
// Next, you will define your `Manager` class as a child of the `Employee` class
// that inherits all of the same properties.

// > **Note**: A `Manager` may be under another `Manager` because
// >`Manager`s might report to higher-level `Manager`s.

// You will need an additional `employees` property that holds an array of all
// `Employee`s assigned to the `Manager`.

const employees = require('./employee')

class Manager {
